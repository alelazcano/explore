A common approach to building browser extensions supported by multiple web browsers.

The goal: produced a preliminary specification that described an browser extension platform that was closely modeled after Chrome's approach. Extensions written to this specification could potentially work on Chrome, Edge, Opera and Firefox. Currently, extension developers are collaborating to increase compatibility across browsers and to specify a common extension platform.

WebExtensions were first specified by the [Browser Extension Community Group](https://browserext.github.io/). Due to the drop in activity in this pioneering group, they have invited their participants to participate in a new and more active one: [WebExtension Community Group](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions).
